# Test Directory

This folder contains example test files used during development of the InvoWise project.

## Purpose
The goal of this directory is to keep:
- sample invoices (PDF/PNG/JPG) used for API testing,
- mock data for analytics checks,
- temporary files for validating export (CSV/JSON),
- notes and scratch tests created during feature development.

## Notes
Files in this directory are not part of the production workflow.
They are used only for local development and debugging.

## Status
Tests here help verify:
- `/analytics` endpoint behaviour,
- invoice parsing flow,
- dashboard data aggregation,
- CSV/JSON export correctness.

Updates will be added as new features appear in the InvoWise pipeline.
